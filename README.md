## Configuration

### 1. files folder
- `private_keys.txt`: Private keys Solana
- `proxy.txt`: One proxy per line (format: `http://user:pass@ip:port`)


### 2. Main configurations
```yaml
# Whether to encrypt private keys
private_key_encryption: true

# Number of threads to use for processing wallets
threads: 1

# BY DEFAULT: [0,0] - all wallets
# Example: [2, 6] will run wallets 2,3,4,5,6
# [4,4] will run only wallet 4
range_wallets_to_run: [0,0]

# Whether to shuffle the list of wallets before processing
shuffle_wallets: true

# Working only if range_wallet_to_run = [0,0] 
# BY DEFAULT: [] - all wallets 
# Example: [1, 3, 8] - will run only 1, 3 and 8 wallets

## Usage

For your security, you can enable private key encryption by setting `private_key_encryption: true` in the `settings.yaml`. If set to `false`, encryption will be skipped.

On first use, you need to fill in the `private_keys.txt` file once. After launching the program, go to `DB Actions → Import wallets to Database`.

If encryption is enabled, you will be prompted to enter and confirm a password. Once completed, your private keys will be deleted from the private_keys.txt file and securely moved to a local database, which is created in the files folder.

If you want to update proxy/twitter/discord/email you need to make synchronize with DB. After you made changes in these files, please choose this option.

Once the database is created, you can start the project by selecting `Titan → Start SPOT Activity (swaps)`.

1. `Start SPOT Activity (swaps)`- If your wallet has no assets on first run, the script will withdraw SOL from OKX and swap SOL to stablecoins, leaving a small amount of SOL (`sol_balance_for_commissions`) reserved for transaction fees.
Then it will perform swaps between USDT and USDC.
If your wallet already has stablecoins and SOL, the script will only perform swaps using the existing stablecoins.
2. `Withdraw additional SOL to wallets` - The script withdraws SOL from OKX to your wallet.
3. `Swap all SOL to UDST/USDC` - The script swaps all available SOL in your wallet to stablecoins, leaving only the amount needed for fees (`sol_balance_for_commissions`).
4. `Update wallet statistics from app.titan` - The script retrieves and updates your wallet statistics from the Titan leaderboard in your database.
